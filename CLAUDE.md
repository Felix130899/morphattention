## Name
masterthesis_fish_VIT

## Purpose
XAI on ViT attention maps for fish morphology (NHM Wien imagery)

## Non-negotiable constraints
- Local-only processing, no cloud/external APIs
- Only Neo + supervisor access; weights never published
- NHM attribution required in public outputs

## Current state
- SAM ViT-L integration: loader + smoke test done, not yet wired into devcontainer

## Next steps
1. Run smoke test in actual container
2. Wire into devcontainer.json postCreateCommand
3. Pin verified deps in requirements.txt

## Detailed log
See vault/thesis-log/ (symlinked, see below)

## Update protocol (read this before editing this file)
- "Current State" and "Next Steps": OVERWRITE, never append.
- Max 5 bullets each. Hitting the cap means something belongs in
  vault/thesis-log/ instead — link it, don't inline it.
- Only include state changes that are true as of THIS session.
- A "Next Steps" item only counts if it's concrete enough to start
  without re-deriving context (not "improve model" — "add SamPredictor
  fallback for tray images with >1 fish per mask").
- Never touch "Purpose" or "Non-negotiable constraints" unless Neo
  explicitly asks.
